  <h1>Reaction to Fantastic Beasts and where to find them</h1>
<img src="photo1.jpg" />
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Fanatstic Beasts does double duty as yet another imagination-tickling fantasy adventure and a deeply troubled commentary on tolerance,
fear and bigotry in the world today.
Focusing on a scatter-brained magizoologist named Newt Scamander ( played by Eddie Redmayne),
whose personal crusade for the protection of magical creatures will eventually lead him to publiosh the aforementioned guide,
, this often heavy-handed political allegory trades present-day England for Prohibition-era New York,
at a time when conflicts between magic folk and No-Majs (American for “Muggle”) are brewing — 
when the humans aren’t fighting world wars among themselves, that is.</p>
